# SkyMesh (sky-sphere) for Unity
Do you want to use your own **sky sphere model** made in 3D modeling software (e.g. Blender, Maya)?
In that case, the SkyMesh shader in this repository will be more **useful and efficient** than built-in shaders.

## How to use.
### 0. Think twice if you really need to render sky with your mesh.
In many cases, you should use [Skybox](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Skybox.html) instead.
Unity can import several types of cubemaps (http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Cubemap.html). 

### 1. Import your sky model.
...
### 2. Choose radius of the sky. Finite or infinite?
...
### 3. Choose renderer. MeshRenderer or CommandBuffer?
...
## How it works? Why good?
